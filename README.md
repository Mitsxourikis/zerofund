# ZeroFund - If you build it, we will fund #

ZeroFund.org is a fund started by Startupers that helps European startups, build their minimum viable product in less than a month by providing a crowd resourcing platform and zero (yep, that is 0) funding â€“ at least at the beginning.

Once the startups go through the ZeroFund process they will be shortlisted to join the MindTheBridge accelerator in SF, receive up to $65k in seed funding and at least one will enter the accelerator on the spot.
